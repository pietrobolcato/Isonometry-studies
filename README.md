# Isonometry studies
____

This series explores a research for textural aesthetic using generative techniques. Simple two-dimensional shapes are drawn as single points in the space, and projected in isonometry. By applying an accelleration force, they move, creating a three dimensional feeling. Varying forces and shapes lead to different types of textural sensations, ranging from raw surfaces to smooth planes.
